Then, the admin will create a task and assigned this to an employee. When the employee has already assigned a task, the employee will log in to the system
 each time they have progressed for a certain task and submit their progress details to store in the system database.
 When the employee finally completed the task, they must check the "Task Completed â€œcheck box so that the evaluator can start to evaluate their accomplishment

 and rate their performance. After the employee marks the task assigned to them as Completed Task,
the evaluator can now begin to evaluate the performance of the employee.
